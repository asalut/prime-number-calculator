# Prime Number Calculator app
This is a technical assessment for my application at Westpac. The main requirements are as follows:
- Algorithm to sum prime numbers to ten million.
- RESTful API to return the result of the algorithm.
- Instructions to run the application.
- Tests to support your answer.

The definition of a prime numbers as per Wikipedia:
- A natural number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a prime number (or a prime) if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers.

This app calculates the sum of prime numbers between two numbers. 
Within this app, an API is exposed and can be used primarily for getting the sum of prime numbers to 10,000,000. 
This API can be called without providing any parameter and request body. 
However, the parameter ***startNumber*** can be used to set the starting point/number of the calculation.

For checking, this resource could be used to calculate the sum of prime numbers between the given numbers:
